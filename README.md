# ðŸ§± Mauricio Ventura â€“ 3D Art Showcase

This repo highlights selected 3D modeling and environment design work from my time at Full Sail University and personal projects. My background in 3D pipelines now informs the GenAI systems I build, giving me a deep understanding of how assets are made, optimized, and deployed in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¨ Tools Used
`Maya`, `Blender`, `Substance Painter`, `Unreal Engine`, `Unity`, `ZBrush`, `Photoshop`

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters
As I build AI systems that interact with or generate 3D assets, my foundation in modeling and real-time engines allows me to *understand the structure* behind the pixels. This repo serves both as a nod to my roots and a stepping stone into 3D GenAI.
